Task: Integrate Vapi.ai for real AI voice calls in "Звонки клиентам"

Work Log:
- Read and analyzed existing fake call implementation (CallScriptDialog, CallHistoryDialog, /api/calls)
- Updated Prisma schema: added vapiApiKey, vapiPhoneId, vapiPhone to User model; callType, vapiCallId, cost to CallLog
- Generated Prisma client
- Created /api/vapi/settings/route.ts (GET/POST/DELETE) for managing Vapi API key & phone number
- Rewrote /api/calls/route.ts to make real calls via Vapi.ai REST API with proper system prompts per call type
- Created /api/vapi/webhook/route.ts for receiving Vapi call status updates (transcript, summary, duration, cost)
- Completely redesigned CallScriptDialog with Vapi integration:
  - VapiSettingsDialog for API key & phone number configuration
  - Call type selection cards (confirmation, reminder, follow_up, custom)
  - Client phone input only (company phone from Vapi settings)
  - Connection status indicator
  - Real-time call status display
- Updated CallHistoryDialog with call type badges, status colors, and cost display
- Updated capabilities card text ("Позвонить" button, "Vapi.ai" badge)
- Fixed unused variable (loadingSettings)
- Ran lint — clean
- Pushed as commit 9e48d57

Stage Summary:
- Vapi.ai is fully integrated for real AI voice calls
- Customer configures their own Vapi API key and phone number
- 4 call types: confirmation, reminder, follow-up, custom
- Webhook endpoint receives transcript, summary, duration, cost from Vapi
- Each customer pays Vapi directly (no telephony costs on our side)
- Next: customer needs to set up Vapi account, get API key, buy phone number, configure in settings
